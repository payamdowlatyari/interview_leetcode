On each of the following N days (numbered 1 through N), Chef is planning to cook either pizza or broccoli. 
He wrote down a string A with length N, where for each valid i, if the character A_i is '1', then he will 
cook pizza on the i-th day, while if A_i is '0', he will cook broccoli on this day.

Chefu, his son, loves pizza but hates broccoli ― just like most kids. He wants to select a substring of 
A with length K and change each character '0' in this substring to '1'. Afterwards, let's define pizza 
time as the maximum number of consecutive days where Chef will cook pizza. Find the maximum pizza time 
Chefu can achieve.

Input
K and Matrix A with length N.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum pizza time.

Example:
Test case 1:
input = [2,[0101110000101]]
output = Chefu can choose the substring A[2,3] = "10", and change the third character of A to '1'. 
Then, the pizza time is 5 days: from day 2 to day 6.

Test case 2:
input = [3,[100001]]
output = Chefu can choose the substring A[2,4] = "000". Then, the pizza time is 4 days: from day 1 to 4
